# Let's take a look at Ubuntu 21.10

Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux distributions. The first release was 08.04 back in 2008. It started as a project to make debian more user friendly. 
Under Canonicals stewardship it has grown to be almost synonomous with Linux espescially on the desktop. Although there always were good alternatives, and recently there has been some serious contenders like Pop_OS, Manjaro Linux, Fedora and Open Suse Tumbleweed.
