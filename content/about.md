Hello, World!

The primary purpose of this blog is to function as a way for me to structured .
to let me show some of my skills in Linux and DevOps. 

The style migtht be a mix of tech-diary, how to articles with a meta-story about running your own k8s cluster at home on your own hardware.

I have been, and still is very interested in de-googling yourself and generally taking back ownership of data in the cloud age. 


I am trying to pivot into tech. 
I am looking for Kubernetes, GitOps and general Linux work.
