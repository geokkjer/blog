Let's take a look at [Fedora Workstation 35](https://getfedora.org/).

Fedora is the upsteam distribution for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and as such is often released with the latest versions of many Linux projects, like GNOME.
It currently comes in five different editions. The one we are taking a look at here is the workstation edition which is
the traditional desktop edition. They also offer the Fedora Silverblue edition, which is an imutable desktop where software is installed with flatpak. This is an intersting concept that might be worthy of another post.

It comes with the GNOME desktop, and in the 35 release that would be GNOME 41 which is the latest GNOME release.
