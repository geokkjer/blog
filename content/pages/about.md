Hello, World!

The primary purpose of this blog is to function as a way for me document some projects that I have been and still is very preoccupied with. It will also let me show some of my skills in Linux and DevOps.

The first series of posts/articles will be introductory, as you could with some googeling and readin the freindy manual, easily reproduce them. This is done for me to familiarize myself with the format, markdown and to test the capabilities of the theme. Ther might be an article about gorking and extending it if the need arises.

The style migtht be a mix of tech-diary, how to articles with a meta-story about running your own k8s cluster at home on your own hardware.

I have been, and still is very interested in de-googling yourself and generally taking back ownership of data in the cloud age. So the end goal, and purpose with this project is to have a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster running on metal with as many services as the hardware will permit. The apps I am looking at is Nextcloud, some implementation of git like gitea or gitlab, maybe a selfhosted bitwarden instance like vaultwarden and some media server, i mostly listen to audiobooks so maybe booksonic-air. I am trying to pivot into tech. I am looking for Kubernetes, GitOps and general Linux work.
