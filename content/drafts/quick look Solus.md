This time we are going to take a look at Solus and their Budgie desktop environment.
Solus is an independent Linux distro that had it's start in 2015. So in a way it's a relative newcommer to the Linux distro landscape. With it comes the Budgie desktop environment based on the GTK toolkit.
They bill themself as :

> The Personal OS for Personal Computers.
A modern operating system to power your daily needs. Install today, update forever.

So they are following a rolling release much like Arch Linux and Gentoo, but with a more curated offering.
