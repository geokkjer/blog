World!\nThe primary purpose of this blog is to function as a way for me document some projects that I have been and still is very preoccupied with. It will also let me show some of my skills in Linux and DevOps.\nThe first series of posts/articles will be introductory, as you could with some googeling and readin the freindy manual, easily reproduce them. This is done for me to familiarize myself with the format, markdown and to test the capabilities of the theme. Ther might be an article about gorking and extending it if the need arises.\nThe style migtht be a mix of tech-diary, how to articles with a meta-story about running your own k8s cluster at home on your own hardware.\nI have been, and still is very interested in de-googling yourself and generally taking back ownership of data in the cloud age. So the end goal, and purpose with this project is to have a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster running on metal with as many services as the hardware will permit. The apps I am looking at is Nextcloud, some implementation of git like gitea or gitlab, maybe a selfhosted bitwarden instance like vaultwarden and some media server, i mostly listen to audiobooks so maybe booksonic-air. I am trying to pivot into tech. I am looking for Kubernetes, GitOps and general Linux work.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/about/","title":"about me"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/archive/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/archive/","title":"blog archive (all posts)"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/","title":""},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/Linux/Arch Linux/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/Linux/Arch Linux/","title":"Arch Linux"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/Linux/Arch Linux/what/":{"body":"What is even Arch Linux ?\nIs it a Linux distro ? or a meta-distro ?\nYes and yes.\nHistory(as far as I know it)\nArch started\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/Linux/Arch Linux/what/","title":"What is Arch Linux ?"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/Linux/Linux From Scratch/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/Linux/Linux From Scratch/","title":"Linux From Scratch"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/Linux/NixOS/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/Linux/NixOS/","title":"NixOS"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/Linux/NixOS/what/":{"body":"What is even NixOS ?\nIs it a Linux distro ? or a meta-distro ? or a package manager ?\nYes and yes and ... yes.\nHistory(as far as I know it)\nNix started by \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/Linux/NixOS/what/","title":"What is NixOS?"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/containerizing-the-app/":{"body":"Intro\nSetting up the build environment\nMaking the Dockerfile\nTesting\nslim.ai\nConclusion\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/containerizing-the-app/","title":"Containerizing the app"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/continous-delivery/":{"body":"Intro\nArgo CD\nConclusion\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/continous-delivery/","title":"Continous delivery"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/devops/":{"body":"Hello testing markdown here too.\n\nProject status\n\n\nDesign\n\nMockups\n\nDevelopment\n\nUnit testing\n\nQA\n\nStage\n\nBeta Testing\n\nProduction\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/devops/","title":"DevOps"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/flask/":{"body":"Intro\nWhat ?\nConclusion\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/flask/","title":"Flask"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/install-arch-linux/":{"body":"Downloading the iso\nInstall method\n1.wiki\n2.interactive installer\n3.automated installer\nStep by step ie the wiki method\nThe other two\nConclusion\nArch is the best\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/install-arch-linux/","title":"How to install Arch Linux"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/install-gentoo/":{"body":"Intro\nWhat is Gentoo ?\nDownloading the iso\nStep by step install\nConclusion\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/install-gentoo/","title":"How to install Gentoo"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/install-nixos/":{"body":"Intro\nWhat is NixOS ?\nDownloading the iso\nStep by step install\nConclusion\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/install-nixos/","title":"How to install NixOS"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/install-open-suse/":{"body":"Open Suse\nwget https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04.3/ubuntu-20.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/install-open-suse/","title":"How to install Open Suse Leap"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/installing-kubernetes/":{"body":"Intro\nAn attempt to install kubernetes on my bare metal home lab.\nSidero\nI have been fascinated by Talos and \nSidero project for some time.\nkubectl get nodes\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/installing-kubernetes/","title":"Installing Kubernetes"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/kubernetes-the-hard-way/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/kubernetes-the-hard-way/","title":"Kubernetes the hard way"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/looking-at-free-bsd/":{"body":"Downloading the iso\nInstall method\n1.wiki\n2.interactive installer\n3.automated installer\nStep by step ie the wiki method\nThe other two\nConclusion\nArch is the best\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/looking-at-free-bsd/","title":"Looking at Free BSD"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/starting-with-git/":{"body":"Intro what is git ?\nInstalling git\nConfiguring git\nConnect to github\nConclusion\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/starting-with-git/","title":"Starting with git"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/zola-is-nice/":{"body":"Zola is the static site generator that was used to build this blog.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/drafts/zola-is-nice/","title":"Zola"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/hello-world/":{"body":"Hello World!
